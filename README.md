- 👋 Hi, I’m @SBG72, or Sara Gable!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the world around us, including health and safety, and how we can use software to improve that!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my programming skills such as C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and many more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that use my current skills or teach me new ones, including front or back-end development, database management, or improving functionality!
